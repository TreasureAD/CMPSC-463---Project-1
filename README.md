# ***Project Goals***
1. The goal of this project is to create a hybrid sorting algorithm that combine two sorting techniques and compare the eficiency of all three. The hybrid sorting algorithm that I chose to use was the Timsort sorting algorithm, which combines insertion sort and merge sort sorting techniques. I will compare the time complexities and run time of all three sorting algorithms. Using several test cases to test the efficiency of each one.

# ***Algorithm Description***
The hybrid sorting algorithm I decided to use was Timsort, which combines merge sort and insertion sort sorting techniques.

Merge sort:

Insertion Sort:
